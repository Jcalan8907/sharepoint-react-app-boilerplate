## sharepoint-react-app-boilerplate

A boilerplate for creating React-based SPAs with SharePoint.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and enhanced with the following:

### UI Components

- [@material-ui/core](https://material-ui.com/) - React components that implement Google's Material Design.

### Frameworks

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Static type checking.
- [lodash](https://lodash.com/) - A modern JavaScript utility library.
- [moment](https://momentjs.com/) - Parse, validate, manipulate and display dates and times in JavaScript.
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.

### SharePoint

- [sp-rest-proxy](https://github.com/koltyakov/sp-rest-proxy) - Provides a proxy to a SharePoint environment for live testing.
- [@pnp/js](https://github.com/pnp/pnpjs) - Fluent JavaScript API for consuming SharePoint and Office 365 REST APIs with TypeScript support.

### Unit Testing

- [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) - Hooks git to perform custom tasks on pre-commit.
- [nock](https://github.com/nock/nock) - Allows for mocking REST endpoints for end-to-end testing without a live backend.
- [enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) - JavaScript testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate and traverse React components.

### Other

- [craco](https://github.com/sharegate/craco) - A package created by the ShareGate team to allow configuring CRA without ejecting.
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Why lint when you can auto-fomat your code?

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm test-coverage`

Launches the test runner in coverage mode to generates and display code coverage.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Commit hooks

On pre-commit this boilerplate will:

1. Execute prettier to ensure code format consistency
2. Execute unit-tests to ensure >80% code coverage.

if either of the above fail, the commit will not succeed.

## Suggested VSCode Extensions

- `TSLint` - Integrates TSLint with VSCode

## Optional (untested/needs configuration)

- `debugger-for-chrome` debug browser apps running in Chrome via VSCode without leaving VSCode
- `jest` - Allows for interactive debugging when executing unit tests (?)
